### About Myself

Born and live in Armenia. Have MS degree in **Power Engineering**. Always had passion for tech and dreamed of gettting into **programming**, but has not made up my mind till recently. After some research decided to get into **Web Development**. In 2020 participated in a JS training course at _Armenian Coding Academy_, which allowed me to creat a solid background in JS. Consider **RS School FEDC** one of the best opportunities to gain new skills, deepen my knowledge and finally create a solid portfolio of projects.
The goal is to get a position at **EPAM** or a comparable level company.

  {
    const iter = xs[Symbol.iterator]();
